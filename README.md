Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting traffic accidents in the United States using machine learning techniques. By leveraging the US Traffic Accident Data for the year 2023, the aim is to uncover insights and patterns that can help improve road safety and accident prevention.

Dataset

The dataset includes comprehensive details of traffic accidents across the United States for the year 2023. Key features include:
- Date and time of the accident
- Location (city, state, and coordinates)
- Weather conditions
- Road conditions
- Traffic signals and signs
- Vehicles involved
- Severity of the accident

Objectives

1. Data Exploration and Visualization: Understand the distribution and characteristics of traffic accidents.
2. Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features from the dataset to improve model performance.
3. Predictive Modeling: Develop machine learning models to predict the likelihood and severity of traffic accidents.
4. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of different models and select the best-performing one.
5. Insights and Recommendations: Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.
